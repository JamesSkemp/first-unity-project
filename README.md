# First Unity Project
Following the [official 2D UFO tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/s/2d-ufo-tutorial).

At this point I don't think I'll get too far into using Unity, but would like to know how to use it so that I can work with an asset I purchased from the Unity store, which can create sprites for non-Unity games.
